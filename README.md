# Shuto's build of st (simple terminal)

This is my personal [st](https://st.suckless.org/) fork with some patches applied.

## Features

+ scrollback with `Shift-PageUp/Down` or `Shift-MouseWheel`
+ spawn new terminal which will have the same current working directory with `Ctrl-Shift-Return`
+ [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colors
+ added support for background transparency (note that it requires X composite manager like [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom))
+ minor visual improvments
